      In this module we will use <abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> and
      <abbr title="CSS">CSS</abbr>.
    </p>
    <p>Example of a CSS rule:</p>
    <code>
      <pre>
           body {
             color: #ff0000;
             font-family: Arial, Verdana;
             }
            </pre
      >
    </code>
    <br /><br />
    <p>
      A certain HTML element allows text to be displayed as it is entered in the
      editor. This is called 'preformatted'. To boot an Ubuntu operating system,
      you need to type the command <kbd>sudo reboot</kbd> in the terminal and
      press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key. After that, the operating system responds
      with the message The system is going down and the PC shuts down.

      <strong>Very important </strong> words or text passages are highlighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Words or text passages that are <em>emphasized</em> when speaking can<em
        >also</em
      >
      be emphasized in HTML.
    </p>
    <p>A text can be <mark>highlighted</mark>, like with a text marker.</p>
    <p>
      In mathematics, some text is <sup>superscripted</sup> or
      <sub>subscripted</sub>, just like &pi; <sup>2</sup>.
    </p>

    <p>The text in the footer is often<small>printed small.</small></p>
    <p>
      Of course you can combine all these HTML elements. Whether this
      <em>always makes <strong>sense</strong></em
      >, however, is questionable. In any case, make sure that the elements are
      <em>always nested correctly</em> and always follow the basic rule: the
      <strong>first opened</strong> element is <strong>closed last</strong>.
