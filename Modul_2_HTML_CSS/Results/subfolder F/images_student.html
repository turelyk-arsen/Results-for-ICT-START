    <h3>About this game</h3>

    <p>
      The Last of Us is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog
      and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. Players control Joel, a
      smuggler tasked with escorting a teenage girl, Ellie, across a
      post-apocalyptic United States. The Last of Us is played from a
      third-person perspective. Players use firearms and improvised weapons and
      can use stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic
      creatures infected by a mutated fungus in the genus Cordyceps. In the
      online multiplayer mode, up to eight players engage in cooperative and
      competitive gameplay. Development of The Last of Us began in 2009, soon
      after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, Uncharted 2: Among
      Thieves. For the first time in the company's history, Naughty Dog split
      into two teams; while one team developed Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception,
      the other half developed The Last of Us. The relationship between Joel and
      Ellie became the focus, with all other elements developed around it.
      Actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson portrayed Joel and Ellie,
      respectively, through voice and motion capture, and assisted creative
      director Neil Druckmann with the development of the characters and story.
      The original score was composed and performed by Gustavo Santaolalla.
      Following its announcement in December 2011, The Last of Us was widely
      anticipated. It was released for the PlayStation 3 in June 2013. It
      received critical acclaim, with praise for its narrative, gameplay,
      visuals, sound design, score, characterization, and depiction of female
      characters. The Last of Us became one of the best-selling video games,
      selling over 1.3 million units in its first week and 17 million by April
      2018. The game won year-end accolades, including multiple Game of the Year
      awards, from several gaming publications, critics, and game award
      ceremonies. It has been cited as one of the greatest video games ever
      made.
