          <h3>Explanation</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
          A <strong>proverb</strong> (from Latin: <em>proverbium</em>) is a
          simple and concrete saying, popularly known and repeated, that
          expresses a truth based on common sense or experience. They are often
          metaphorical. A proverb that describes a basic rule of conduct may
          also be known as a maxim. Proverbs fall into the category of formulaic
          language.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proverbs are often borrowed from similar languages and cultures, and
          sometimes come down to the present through more than one language.
          Both the Bible (including, but not limited to the Book of Proverbs)
          and medieval Latin (aided by the work of Erasmus) have played a
          considerable role in distributing proverbs across Europe. Mieder has
          concluded that cultures that treat the Bible as their "major spiritual
          book contain between three hundred and five hundred proverbs that stem
          from the Bible." However, almost every culture has examples of its own
          unique proverbs.
